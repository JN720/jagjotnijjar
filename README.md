This is my personal website and ePortfolio which will include revamped deployments of some of my other ML 
models as accessible APIs and will be equipped with a database to store inferences. As I develop more skills
and get more projects ready for public view, I will update the static information on the site. However,
all of my non-publically-ready projects will still be viewable on Github.

#Server Down
Most likely the model will not be deployed due to the cloud costs of maintaining multiple ML models.
By request of reaching out on LinkedIn, I can temporarily re-enable the deployments for any curious viewers.
