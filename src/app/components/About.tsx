            <p>I am a Computer Science student and aspiring AI Engineer.
                I build machine learning models and integrate them with other software for an AI-enhanced experience.
                In addition to my best skills, Python for Machine Learning and C++ for academic work, I am familiar
                with a variety of languages and software to incorporate into AI-integrated full-stack development. 
                For instance, this very website was built in React with Bootstrap and calls REST API's built in Express
                for my models!
